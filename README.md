# Model Soups for Text Classification

Shows an implementation of model soups [1] for text classification models.

## Notebooks

* `notebooks/train-models.ipynb` shows how to obtain the fine-tuned text classification
models using `Trainer` and `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` classes from ðŸ¤— Transformers.
* `notebooks/model-soups.ipynb` shows how to obtain model soups using two recipes presented in [1].

## Results

TBA
